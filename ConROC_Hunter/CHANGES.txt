ConROC_Hunter v2.0.0 - TBC Anniversary Edition
================================================

COMPLETE REBUILD for TBC Classic (Anniversary Edition)

CRITICAL FIXES:
- Interface version corrected: 11506 → 20504 (TBC Anniversary)
- Removed ALL Season of Discovery contamination

SoD CONTAMINATION REMOVED:
- Removed entire ids.Engrave section (SoD rune engraving system)
- Removed entire ids.Runes section (SoD rune abilities)
- Removed all SoD trap variants (FrostTrapSoD, FreezingTrapSoD, ExplosiveTrapSoD,
  ImmolationTrapSoD) and associated SoD rank tables
- Removed all SoD Raptor Strike variants (RaptorStrikeSoD ranks)
- Removed all WyvernStrike SoD entries
- Removed ids.Buff.LockandLoad and ids.Buff.RaptorFury (SoD buffs)
- Removed all ConROC.Seasons.IsSoD and ConROC:RuneEquipped conditionals
  from UpdateSpellID() - now TBC-only, no branching
- Removed entire SoD rotation branch from Damage() function
- Removed SoD rune variables from rotation: Carve, ChimeraShot, ExplosiveShot,
  FlankingStrike, HeartoftheLion, KillCommand, KillShot, LoneWolf, WyvernStrike
- Removed _LockandLoad_BUFF variable and all Lock and Load trap combo logic
- Removed _can_Execute variable (unused in TBC rotation)
- Removed AspectoftheFalcon SoD rune from indicators and spellmenu
- Removed SoD-specific spellmenu entries: ChimeraShot, HeartoftheLion,
  KillShot, FlankingStrike, Carve, WyvernStrike

BUGS FIXED:
- Fixed JustCasted() function: was comparing spellID to ability object reference
  instead of the actual spell ID (75 = Auto Shot). Fixed to spellID == 75
- Fixed Enum.PowerType.Mana (retail API) → UnitPower('target', 0)
  (correct Classic/TBC API for mana power type)
- Fixed HasWindfury() function removed - was only used in SoD WingClip proc path
  which no longer exists in TBC rotation

TBC-SPECIFIC ADDITIONS:
- Added Aspect of the Hawk Rank 7 (38784) - TBC level 64 rank
- Added Arcane Shot Rank 9 (27019) - TBC level 60 rank
- Added Multi Shot Rank 5 (27021) - TBC level 60 rank
- Added Volley Rank 4 (27022) - TBC level 60 rank
- Added Serpent Sting Rank 10 (27016) - TBC level 60 rank
- Updated UpdateSpellID() to include all new TBC ranks in rank checks
- Corrected Aspect of the Viper reqLevel in spellmenu (1 → 20)

ROTATION CLEANUP:
- Ranged rotation restructured: Hunter's Mark → Cooldowns (BW/RF) →
  Aimed Shot → Sting → AoE shots → Arcane Shot filler → Auto Shot
- Pre-pull opener preserved: Hunter's Mark + Aimed Shot cast when out of combat
- Melee rotation preserved and clean: Counterattack > Mongoose Bite >
  Intimidation > Scatter Shot > Wing Clip > Raptor Strike > Auto Attack
- Removed all Chimera Shot, Kill Shot, and Lock and Load trap combos
  that were incorrectly present in the non-SoD rotation branch
