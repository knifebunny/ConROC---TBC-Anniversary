# ConROC – TBC Anniversary Edition

> **Conflict Rotation Optimizer Classic** — a World of Warcraft addon that provides real-time spell suggestions and visual rotation cues to help players optimise their gameplay.

This is a fork of the original [ConROC by Vae2009](https://github.com/Vae2009/ConROC), completely rebuilt for **The Burning Crusade Classic Anniversary Edition**. Development continues with the kind permission and support of the original author.

**Special thanks to [Vae2009](https://github.com/Vae2009)** for creating ConROC and for generously allowing this project to carry it forward into TBC Classic. The original concept, core framework, and addon architecture are entirely his work.

## Installation

### Step 1 — Download

Go to the [Releases](../../releases) page and download the latest zip file.

### Step 2 — Extract

Extract the zip. Inside you will find a folder named something like `ConROC-TBC-v2.0.2` — open it to find the addon folders inside.

### Step 3 — Copy to WoW

Copy the folders you need into your WoW AddOns directory:

```
World of Warcraft\_classic_era_\Interface\AddOns\
```

You **always need two folders**:
- `ConROC` — the core addon (required)
- Your class folder — e.g. `ConROC_Paladin`, `ConROC_Warlock`, etc.

You do **not** need to install class folders for classes you don't play.

### Step 4 — Enable In Game

At the character select screen, click **AddOns** and make sure both `ConROC` and your class module are ticked. Log in and ConROC will start working immediately.

## How It Works

Once in game, ConROC displays a visual indicator showing your next recommended ability. Suggestions update in real time based on your current buffs, debuffs, cooldowns, resources, and talent spec.

**Slash Commands:**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/conroc` | Toggle the addon on/off |
| `/conroc menu` | Open the spell configuration menu |
| `/ConROCPT` | Print your talent tree with IDs (debugging) |

## What Changed From the Original

This fork resolves significant issues that prevented ConROC from running in TBC Anniversary:

- Removed all Season of Discovery (SoD) content that contaminated the original class modules
- Replaced retail-only WoW API calls with TBC Classic compatible equivalents
- Correct TBC spell IDs and ranks implemented across all class modules
- Spell rank flexibility — any rank of a suggested spell now satisfies the rotation, preventing stalls when using downranked spells for mana efficiency
- Automatic talent-based spec detection across all classes
- Interface version correctly set to `20504` (TBC Anniversary)

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the full detail of changes per class.

## Reporting a Bug

Please open an [Issue](../../issues) and include:

- Your **class and spec**
- What ConROC **suggested** vs what the **correct ability** was
- Your addon **version** (from the release zip name)
- Any **BugSack error output** if you have it

The more detail you include, the faster it can be looked into.
